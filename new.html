	<span class><strong>Welcome to Prince of Peace Lutheran Church!</strong><br /><br />
	<p>Thank you for taking time to check us out. Whether you are visiting or looking for a church home, we want you to feel welcomed by and comfortable with our congregation while being inspired and uplifted by our worship service.</p>
	<p>Prince of Peace Lutheran Church, referred to as POP, is where lots of different people come together for the shared purpose of worshiping God and encouraging each other. We invite you to come to our services. We are glad to have guests and we won't do anything to embarrass you.</p>
	<p>At one time or another every one of us were new to POP. Stepping through the doorway for the first couple of times can be overwhelming. Even little things such as locating a bathroom can invoke a level of angst. To help you feel more comfortable attending, we have put together some general information about the church service. Click <a href="worship.html" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a> to view that information.</p>
	<p>Let us know you're planning on attending by contacting Pastor Allyn at (412) 719-8811 or <a href="mailto:prallynitterly@gmail.com"><u>email</u></a>. She'll arrange for you to be met by one of members who will guide you around, introduce you to others, and sit with you during the service.</p>
	<p>If you are unable to contact pastor before your visit, when you arrive at church please inform the usher that you are new. The usher will have a member assist as described previously.</p>
	<p>If you attend the 10:30 AM service, consider joining us for Fellowship Time immediately afterwards. Coffee, tea, and light snacks are generally available to share while we get to know you.</p>
	<p>Please do not feel obligated to give an offering. Your gifts are welcome, of course, but your time and presence today are enough for now.</p>
	<p>We sincerely hope you will enjoy your time worshipping with us. If you desire information about becoming a member of Prince of Peace Lutheran Church, please let Pastor Allyn know. She will set aside time to discuss this with you.</p>
	<p>If you decide that Prince of Peace Lutheran Church is not the church you desire, we understand and are thankful you gave us the opportunity to meet you.</p>
	<p><i>Go in Peace and serve the Lord.</i></p>
