	<h4><strong>SCRIPT Program (Gift Cards)</strong></h4>
	<p>SCRIP Program (Gift Cards) - Do you understand our Scrip Program? Scrip Program are fund raising gift cards. The same gift cards you would normally purchase from a retailer in your local retail stores, especially Giant Eagle, and they work the same way. You’ll find cards to can use at grocery stores, gas stations, restaurants, movie theaters, home improvement stores, and almost any business that accepts gift cards. They also make great gifts for any occasion. Virtually anywhere you shop will accept some form of Scrip.</p>
	<p>Prince Of Peace receives a rebate for every card sold. Each month the proceeds are designated for a specific project. April orders benefit Lutherlyn. Lutherlyn is a church camp in Butler, PA which combines the love of God with fun, friends, swimming, playing in the woods, adventure challenges. Bible Study, worship, cookouts, campfires, discoveries in nature, games, and a few surprises into an unforgettable experience! Family Camp, Retreats and events throughout the year make this a treasure for ALL ages!</p>
	<p>Script card orders are placed every other week. Orders can be picked up the following week. Interested? Complete a Script Program order form, found on the table in the Narthex, and submit along with payment to Lorie Snyder or Pastor Allyn.</p>
	<p><strong>SCRIP CARDS INVENTORY</strong> are available for immediate purchase for Darden (Olive Garden), Giant Eagle, Home Depot, Sheetz, and Wal-Mart. See Lori Snyder or Pastor Allyn if you need a card ANYTIME!</p>

	<h4><strong>First Food & Friends</strong></h4>
	<p>This ministry of hospitality and sustenance welcomes 80-150 people for fellowship and a nourishing lunch every Saturday at 11:30 a.m. This takes place at The First United Methodist Church, 5401 Centre Ave Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15232.</p>
	<p>Prior to lunch, guests are welcome to participate in a Bible Study at 10:30. At least once each month health professionals from First United Methodist Church of Pittsburgh offer blood pressure screenings and information concerning health care. Patrick Haver is the executive director and welcomes hearing from you if you wish to have more information and or would like to volunteer. You may contact him at (412) 580-1522.</p>
	Prince of Peace members volunteer the second Saturday of every other month. Whatever the meal is, you will help make it, serve it and you will get to eat lunch too. Then of course you get to clean up afterwards. Other than that, a smile and a listening ear as well as a willingness to work is all you need! You will leave feeling tired and grateful.</p>
	<p>Our next volunteer day at First Food & Friends Soup Kitchen will be Saturday May 12, 2018. There is a sign up sheet in the hallway by the Luther Room. We would like to have at least 12 volunteers if possible. You must be 12 years of age or older to volunteer.</p>
	<p>We will be accepting donations year round. You will find a blue bin in the hallway outside of Luther room. We are looking especially for coats, scarves, hats, mittens, gloves, warm socks, sweaters and boots mainly for men, but they can also use women’s items too. We can also take personal care items. “First Food & Friends” Soup Kitchen is at 5401 Centre Ave, Pittsburgh. You can meet us there at 9 am, but parking is limited, or you can carpool with us.</p>
	<p>Please be at the church, ready to leave by 8:15am.</p>
	<p>You are asked to dress comfortably (shorts are fine) and wear your Thrivent or “God’s Work, Our Hands” T-shits… we have Thrivent shirts for anyone who needs them! NO Flip-Flops! Rubber soled shoes, preferably sneakers are important. Whatever the meal is, you will help make it, serve it and you will get to eat lunch too. Then of course you get to clean up afterwards. Other than that, a smile and a listening ear as well as a willingness to work is all you need! You will leave feeling tired and grateful.</p>
